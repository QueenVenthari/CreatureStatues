<h2><b>About this Mod:</b></h2>
Allows you to build custom statues of creatures in the game including bosses. Statues can be found in the Furniture Tab under your hammer and require a workbench to be placed. This mod contains all material variants, however if you want just a specific type, you can find the material variant specifics below.
<br>
<br>The <b>Mistlands</b> update is finally here! Enjoy some reworked statues, as well as new eyes on statues, requiring Greydwarf Eyes and a coloring agent or two depending on the color of the statues eyes.
<br>
<br>This mod was built with the assistance of <a href="https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/" ><b><span>Azumatt</span></b></a>, <a href="https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/coemt/" ><b><span>Coemt</span></b></a>, <a href="https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/CookieMilk/" ><b><span>CookieMilk</span></b></a>, <a href="https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/" ><b><span>Gravebear</span></b></a> from the <b>OdinPlus</b> Team and <a href="https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/HugotheDwarf/" ><b><span>HugotheDwarf</span></b></a>! Their help has been greatly appreciated!
<br>
<br>A huge shout out to <a href="https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Frogger/" ><b><span>Anime</span></b></a> for making the Serpent and Leech models for me!
<br>
<br>If there is a creature I left out that you would like me to add that is <b>NOT</b> the Ghost from the Burial Chambers or the Surtling, please let me know on discord!
